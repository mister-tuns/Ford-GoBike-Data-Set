# Ford-GoBike-Data-Set
> This data set includes information about over 183,000 individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area. The dataset includes features such as the customer type, gender, birth year and ride duration amongst other variables.  

> I wanted to know the factors that drove trips durations and i explored the other variables in this data set with the trip duration. I was curious about whether gender, member type, bike sharing, day of the week or time of the day affected how long trips lasted. The data set can be downloaded here.   

## Summary of Findings  

> It was observed that there were more male than female members, however females spent more time on trips. Most of the members were subscribers rather than just customers. Most members dont share bikes on trips but those that do spent less time on trips. 

> More trips occurred on Thursdays and Tuesdays than the other days. The least trips occurred during the weekend but they usually last longer 

> Most trips last between 500 and 1000 seconds with a lot of members between 20 and 40 years of age being engaged in trips less than 1500 seconds. > Trips around 12am, 2am and 3am last longer than others.    

## Key Insights for Presentation  

> The presentation focuses on explaining the duration variable, days where rides occurred the most and explaining the peak periods for rides in the data set before moving on to explain relationships between weekdays and time duration using a box plot. Finally, i explored the relationship between gender, trip durations and weekdays using a point plot which brought forth some interesting insights.
